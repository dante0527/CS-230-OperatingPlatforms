# OperatingPlatforms
Portfolio Project for CS-230 Operating Platforms

    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
    Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, has a game available on Android where players compete to guess what an image is as it is slowly rendered over the course of 1 minute. They needed us to develop a web-based version of the game so that it can run on any device to be available to a wider audience.

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The documentation for this project consists of design constraints, a software domain model, and considerations for each operating system that the game would be developed and ran on. The ultimate goal was to provide recommendations for development with each of these aspects in mind, and the most valuable here would have been the domain model to help developers understand exactly how the functionality of the game should work.

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

By creating a software design document, the team has a central source of goals and information pertaining to the development of the application that can be used to guide their process with the client's needs and values in mind. It was particularly useful in that it could be referenced for direction at any point, and answers a lot of questions that might come up.

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise,
    what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise any part of the document, it would be the evaluation of development requirements across platforms. This part is especially difficult to formulate due to the vast amount of considerations to be had when designing any software across multiple platforms, since there are many conflicting variables to look at.

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?
    Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are generally the most important part of designing any software, as that is all they will be interacting with when presented with the game. Design and code can be carefully thought out and executed, but if it does not work correctly for the end user, that is all that will be visible outside of the development team. By acting as a user, you get to put yourself in their position and interact with the application from an outside perspective and take note of what would improve the quality of the experience.

    How did you approach designing software?
    What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The software design approach was based on value to the client, whose values are based on value to the user, so our goals were directly aligned with the user experience. For example, considering how to structure the code and what parts would run on the user's device, what parts would be running on the server, and what would make the most sense for that server as a local or cloud based host were all very important in creating a fluid experience.
